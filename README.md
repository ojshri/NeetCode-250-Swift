# NeetCode-Swift
- I post my accepted NeetCode solutions here.
- And edit them with a better solution when I get a better one.

# Steps 
- The solution must be created as a playground file. e.g., 
- The first leetcode problem `Two Sum`, will have a name, `TwoSum.playground`. 
- Provide link to the problem as comments at the top of the playground. 
- The playground must be stored in a directory of appropriate category.
- Like, `22. Generate Parentheses` must be located in `Dynamic Programming` directory.

# Note
- Don't worry about the performance in the beginning. 
- Learn the concepts first and improve it later.
- Do not get tempted to solve the hard ones yet. 
- Medium is sufficient to move to the next topic.
